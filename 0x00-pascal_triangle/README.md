# Pascal's Triangle

This project contains tasks for working with Pascal's triangle.

## Tasks To Complete

+ [ ] 0. **Pascal's Triangle**<br/>[0-pascal_triangle.py](0-pascal_triangle.py) contains a function `def pascal_triangle(n):` that returns a list of lists of integers representing the Pascal's triangle of `n`:
  + Returns an empty list if `n <= 0`.
  + You can assume `n` will be always an integer.

### Tests

The [tests](/0x00-pascal_triangle/tests/) directory contains files used to test the output of the algorithm locally.
